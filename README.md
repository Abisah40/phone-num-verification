Phone number information refers to the details associated with a phone number, including its validity, carrier, location, and type (mobile, landline, VoIP, etc.). It is used for authentication, communication, fraud prevention, and marketing purposes.  

### Key Aspects of Phone Number Information:  
- **Format & Validity:** Ensures the number follows international dialing standards (e.g., E.164 format).  
- **Carrier & Network:** Identifies the telecom provider (e.g., AT&T, Vodafone).  
- **Geolocation:** Provides the country and sometimes the region or city.  
- **Line Type:** Differentiates between mobile, landline, VoIP, or toll-free numbers.  
- **Spam & Fraud Detection:** Helps identify suspicious or blacklisted numbers.  

This information is useful for businesses, security systems, and customer verification processes. Would you like insights on how to retrieve or use phone number data?
